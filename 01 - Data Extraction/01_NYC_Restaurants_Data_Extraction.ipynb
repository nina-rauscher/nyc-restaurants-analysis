    "In order to get data on NYC restaurants, we will use two main data sources: \n",
    "* **DOHMH New York City Restaurant Inspection Results:** a dataset containing all sanitary inspection results for NYC restaurants along with the restaurants features (e.g. cuisine type, longitude, latitude, phone number)\n",
    "* **Yelp API:** it will enable us to retrieve a satisfaction score for a restaurant as well as some other characteristics (e.g., reviews, price category...)\n",
    "\n",
    "We will start by cleaning the data from DOHMH to keep only the latest inspection results for each business and estimate the proportion of restaurants for which the grade is pending to know if it's reasonable to drop it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, we will retrieve the data corresponding to the remaining restaurants using Yelp API phone search to get the business details and id. Once we will have the Yelp ID, we will be able to get an excerpt of the restaurant's reviews by using another API endpoint.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we will clean this data and save the resulting dataset in a csv file to be used later for EDA and modeling."
